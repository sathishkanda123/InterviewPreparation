Functional Interfaces
....................
only one abstract method
Many default methods

Lambda expressions
.................
Lambda expressions basically express instances of functional interfaces
It provides a clear and concise way to represent one method interface using an expression.

Enable to treat functionality as a method argument, or code as data
A function that can be created without belonging to any class.
A lambda expression can be passed around as if it was an object and executed on demand.

Exprsession syntax
.................
(argument-list) -> {body}  



Method References
.................
Method reference is used to refer method of functional interface. It is compact and easy form of lambda expression. 
There are following types of method references in java:

Reference to a static method.
ContainingClass::staticMethodName

Reference to an instance method.
Reference to a constructor.
ContainingClass::new

Java Optional Class
..................

Java introduced a new class Optional in jdk8. It is a public final class and used to deal with NullPointerException in Java application. 


Parallel Sort
.............

1) Arrays.sort() : is a sequential sorting.

The API uses single thread for the operation.
It takes bit longer time to perform the operation.
2. Arrays.ParallelSort() : is a parallel sorting.

The API uses multiple threads for the operation.
Itâ€™s faster when there are a lot of elements whereas slower for lesser elements.


Flat Map
........
map and flatMap in Streams
..........................

The map() method wraps the underlying sequence in a Stream instance, 
whereas the flatMap() method allows avoiding nested Stream<Stream<R>> structure.

List<List<String>> list = Arrays.asList(
  Arrays.asList("a"),
  Arrays.asList("b"));
System.out.println(list)

This snippet prints a list of lists [[a], [b]].

System.out.println(list
  .stream()
  .flatMap(Collection::stream)
  .collect(Collectors.toList()));

The result of such a snippet will be flattened to [a, b].
