JUnit is a unit testing framework for the Java programming language.
JUnit has been important in the development of test-driven development, 
and is one of a family of unit testing frameworks. 
Its main use is to write repeatable tests for your application code units

JUnit test suites help to grouping and executing tests in bulk. 
Executing tests separately for all test classes is not desired in most cases. 
Test suites help in achieving this grouping.

In JUnit, test suites can be created and executed with these annotations.

@RunWith
@SuiteClasses

Using JUnit 5 test suites, you can run tests spread into multiple test classes and different packages. 
JUnit 5 provides two annotations: @SelectPackages and @SelectClasses to create test suites. 

@RunWith(JUnitPlatform.class)
@SelectPackages({"com.howtodoinjava.junit5.examples.packageA","com.howtodoinjava.junit5.examples.packageB"})
public class JUnit5TestSuiteExample
{
}

@RunWith(JUnitPlatform.class)
@SelectClasses( { ClassATest.class, ClassBTest.class, ClassCTest.class } )
public class JUnit5TestSuiteExample
{
}
