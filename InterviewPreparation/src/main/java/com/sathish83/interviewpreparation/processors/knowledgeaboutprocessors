Every computer has a processor, whether it’s a small efficiency processor or a large performance powerhouse, 
or else it wouldn’t be able to function. Of course, the processor, also called the CPU 

The designs of processors are extremely complex and vary widely between companies and even models. 
Their architectures — currently “Ivy Bridge” for Intel and “Piledriver” for AMD — are constantly being improved to pack in 
the most amount of performance in the least amount of space and energy consumption. But despite all the architectural differences, 
processors go through four main steps whenever they process instructions: fetch, decode, execute, and writeback.
