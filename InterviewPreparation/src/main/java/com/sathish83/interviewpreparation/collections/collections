List - Array List , LinkedList, Vector , Stack
....
It can have duplicate values

Array List
..........
Maintaining insertion order 
Non-synchronized
RandomAccessed
Better to for storing and accessing data
Manipulation is slow , since its internally uses array, if any element removed from an array , all the bits are shifted in memory

LinkedList
..........
Using doubley linked list to store elements
Store duplicate values
Maintains Inservtion order
Non synchronized
Manipulation is fast , because no shifting is required


ArrayList vs LinkedList
.......................
Search
......
ArrayList is a index based structure backed by an array, it provides random access to its elements with a performance 
equal to O(1)

LinkedList stores its data as a list of elements and every element is linked to its previous and next element. 
In this case, the search operation for an item has execution time equal to O(n).

Add,Remove and Insert
.....................
The insertion, addition and removal operations of an item are faster in a LinkedList 
because there is no need to resize an array or update the index when an element is added to some arbitrary position inside the collection, 
only references in surrounding elements will change.

Memory usage
...........
A LinkedList consumes more memory than an ArrayList because of every node in a LinkedList stores two references,
 one for its previous element and one for its next element, whereas ArrayList holds only data and its index.




Queue - FIFO - Priority queue, Dequeu and ArrayDeque
.........

PriorityQueue
............
Defined in ordered list
Not allowed null values

Dequeue
........
Double end queue - can remove and add on both sides

ArrayDequeu
...........
Queueu + Dequeueu - faster than ArrayList and stack and has no capacity restrictions


Set - Hash set , linked list and Tree set 
...
Unordered elements of set , not allow duplicate values
Store only one null value


Map - > Hashmap , Linkedhashmap,TreeMap
...
Doesn't allow duplicate keys , but allow duplicate values
Hash map and LinkedHashmap allow null keys and values but tree map doesn't allow any null key or null value
LinkedHashmap - maintains insertion order
TreeMap- ascending order

ConcurrentHashMap
