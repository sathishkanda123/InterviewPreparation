Multithreading in java is a process of executing multiple threads simultaneously.
A thread is a lightweight sub-process, the smallest unit of processing. 
Multiprocessing and multithreading, both are used to achieve multitasking.

However, we use multithreading than multiprocessing because threads use a shared memory area. 
They don't allocate separate memory area so saves memory, and context-switching between the threads takes less time than process
A thread is executed inside the process. There is context-switching between the threads.
There can be multiple processes inside the OS, and one process can have multiple threads.   
At a time one thread is executed only.


Thread scheduler in java is the part of the JVM that decides which thread should run.
The thread scheduler mainly uses preemptive or time slicing scheduling to schedule the threads.


Preemptive Scheduling:
.......................
A scheduling discipline is preemptive if, once a process has been given the CPU can taken away.
Preemptive scheduling is used when a process switches from running state to ready state or from waiting state to ready state.

Shortest Job Next (SJN)
Shortest Remaining Time
Round Robin Scheduling


Non-Preemptive Scheduling:
..........................
A scheduling discipline is nonpreemptive if, once a process has been given the CPU, the CPU cannot be taken away from that process
Non-preemptive Scheduling is used when a process terminates, or a process switches from running to waiting state.
