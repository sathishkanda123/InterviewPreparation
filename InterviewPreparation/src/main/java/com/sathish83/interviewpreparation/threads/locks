ReentrantLock
.............
ReentrantLock is a concrete implementation of Lock interface provided in Java concurrency package from Java 1.5 onwards.
As per Javadoc, ReentrantLock is mutual exclusive lock,
similar to implicit locking provided by synchronized keyword in Java, with extended feature like fairness,
which can be used to provide lock to longest waiting thread.
Lock is acquired by lock() method and held by Thread until a call to unlock() method.
Fairness  parameter is provided while creating instance of ReentrantLock in constructor. 
ReentrantLock provides same visibility and ordering guarantee, 
provided by implicitly locking, which means, unlock() happens before another thread get lock().
