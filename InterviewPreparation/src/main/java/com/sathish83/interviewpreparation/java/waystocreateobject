Following are some ways in which you can create objects in Java:

1) New Keyword

2) Using New Instance
   If we know the name of the class & if it has a public default constructor we can create an object –Class.forName.
   We can use it to create the Object of a Class. Class.forName actually loads the Class in Java but doesn’t create any Object. 
   To Create an Object of the Class you have to use the new Instance Method of the Class.

3) Clone Method

Whenever clone() is called on any object, the JVM actually creates a new object and copies all content 
of the previous object into it. 
Creating an object using the clone method does not invoke any constructor.
To use clone() method on an object we need to implement Cloneable and define the clone() method in it.

4) Using Deserilization
.......................
Whenever we serialize and then deserialize an object, JVM creates a separate object. In deserialization, JVM doesn’t use any constructor to create the object.
To deserialize an object we need to implement the Serializable interface in the class.


5) Using NewInstance method of constructor class
................................................
This is similar to the newInstance() method of a class. There is one newInstance() method in the
java.lang.reflect.Constructor class which we can use to create objects. 
It can also call parameterized constructor, and private constructor by using this newInstance() method.

Both newInstance() methods are known as reflective ways to create objects. In fact newInstance() method of Class internally
 uses newInstance() method of Constructor class.
