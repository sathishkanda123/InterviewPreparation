The SonarScanner is recommended as the default analyzer for Maven projects.
The ability to execute the SonarQube analysis via a regular Maven goal makes 
it available anywhere Maven is available (developer build, CI server, etc.), 
without the need to manually download, setup, and maintain a SonarQube Runner installation. 
The Maven build already has much of the information needed for SonarQube to successfully analyze a project. 
By preconfiguring the analysis based on that information, the need for manual configuration is reduced significantly.

Edit the settings.xml file, 
located in $MAVEN_HOME/conf or ~/.m2, to set the plugin prefix and optionally the SonarQube server URL.
