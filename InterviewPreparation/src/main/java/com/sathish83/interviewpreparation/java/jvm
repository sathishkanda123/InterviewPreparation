Stack Memory in Java
...................
Stack Memory in Java is used for static memory allocation and the execution of a thread. 
It contains primitive values that are specific to a method and references to objects that are in a heap, 
referred from the method.

If this memory is full, Java throws java.lang.StackOverFlowError


Java (JVM) Memory Model
.......................

Jvm heap memory is physically divided into two parts 
a) Young generation
b) Old Generation

The young generation is the place where all the new objects are created. 
When the young generation is filled, garbage collection is performed

This garbage collection is called Minor GC. 
Young Generation is divided into three parts – Eden Memory and two Survivor Memory spaces.

eden
....
Most of the newly created objects are located in the Eden memory space.

When Eden space is filled with objects,
 Minor GC is performed and all the survivor objects are moved to one of the survivor spaces.

 
Old Generation memory contains the objects that are long-lived and 
survived after many rounds of Minor GC. Usually, garbage collection is performed in 
Old Generation memory when it’s full. Old Generation Garbage Collection is called Major GC and usually takes a longer time.

Perm Gem
........
Permanent Generation or “Perm Gen” contains the application metadata 
required by the JVM to describe the classes and methods used in the application. 
Note that Perm Gen is not part of Java Heap memory.


-Xms	For setting the initial heap size when JVM starts
-Xmx	For setting the maximum heap size.
-Xmn	For setting the size of the Young Generation, rest of the space goes for Old Generation.
-XX:PermGen	For setting the initial size of the Permanent Generation memory
-XX:MaxPermGen	For setting the maximum size of Perm Gen
-XX:SurvivorRatio	For providing ratio of Eden space and Survivor Space, for example if Young Generation size is 10m and VM switch is -XX:SurvivorRatio=2 then 5m will be reserved for Eden Space and 2.5m each for both the Survivor spaces. The default value is 8.
-XX:NewRatio	For providing ratio of old/new generation sizes. The default value is 2


Memory Management in Java – Java Garbage Collection Types
.........................................................
There are five types of garbage collection types that we can use in our applications. 
We just need to use the JVM switch to enable the garbage collection strategy for the application. 
Let’s look at each of them one by one.
