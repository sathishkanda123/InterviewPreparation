Regular Expressions or Regex (in short) 
is an API for defining String patterns that can be used for searching,
 manipulating and editing a text. It is widely used to define constraint on strings such as password. 
 Regular Expressions are provided under java.util.regex package.


he Matcher and Pattern classes provide the facility of Java regular expression. The java.util.regex package provides following classes and interfaces for regular expressions.

MatchResult interface
Matcher class
Pattern class
PatternSyntaxException class


Matcher Class Methods
.......................

1   boolean matches()	test whether the regular expression matches the pattern.
2	boolean find()	finds the next expression that matches the pattern.
3	boolean find(int start)	finds the next expression that matches the pattern from the given start number.
4	String group()	returns the matched subsequence.
5	int start()	returns the starting index of the matched subsequence.
6	int end()	returns the ending index of the matched subsequence.
7	int groupCount()	returns the total number of the matched subsequence



Pattern class
.............

1.  static Pattern compile(String regex)	compiles the given regex and returns the instance of the Pattern.
2	Matcher matcher(CharSequence input)	creates a matcher that matches the given input with the pattern.
3	static boolean matches(String regex, CharSequence input)	It works as the combination of compile and matcher methods. It compiles the regular expression and matches the given input with the pattern.
4	String[] split(CharSequence input)	splits the given input string around matches of given pattern.
5	String pattern()	returns the regex pattern.
