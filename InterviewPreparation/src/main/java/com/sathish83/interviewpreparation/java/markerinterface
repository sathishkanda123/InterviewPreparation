It is an empty interface (no field or methods).
 Examples of marker interface are Serializable, Clonnable and Remote interface. All these interfaces are empty interfaces.
 
A marker interface is an interface that has no methods or constants inside it.
It provides run-time type information about objects, 
so the compiler and JVM have additional information about the object.

  interfaces allow us to take advantage of polymorphism. 
  As a result, we can add additional restrictions to the marker interface.
