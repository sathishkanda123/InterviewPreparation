<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>
Multiple Definition from multiple organizations - In a Nutshell It's a single isolated java/server application which works as a module or service in order to build
end to end application

<p align="center">
Microservices are both an architecture and an approach to writing 
software.With microservices,applications are broken down into their smallest components, 
independent from each other.Instead of a traditional, monolithic,approach to apps, where everything is built into a single piece, microservices are all separated and work together to 
accomplish the same tasks.Each of these components,or processes,is a microservice.

A sample ecart <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/microservices-architecture/multi-container-microservice-net-applications/microservice-application-design">Microsoft</a>

<div>
Main challenges in microservices are Load balancing, Distrubuted tracing, Fault tolerance, Datamodeling, Service discovery , Independent releasable ...Some of the design patterns are come up with solutions for this problems 
</div>
If you start a application in microservices , you should learn some other topics, in order to build efficent and scalable applications like
designpatternes,servicediscovery,Api gateway,servicemesh,messaging communication.., i explained one by one in index page please refer through home page
